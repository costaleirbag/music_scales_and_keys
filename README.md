# music_scales_and_keys
Program to generate notes given intervals, intervals given notes, and chords given a scale.


## TO-DO
- Adapt `get_dominant` to work like `generate_scale_from_chord_name`
    - `get_dominant` will receive dominant notes from `generate_scale_from_chord_name`.
    This function doesn't need to generate chord notes and generate a scale. It can do just the first
    and be used by `get_dominant`.
